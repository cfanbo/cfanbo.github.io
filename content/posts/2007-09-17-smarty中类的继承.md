**Extended Setup**
This is a continuation of the basic installation, please read that first!
A slightly more flexible way to setup Smarty is to extend the class and initialize your Smarty environment. So instead of re-
peatedly setting directory paths, assigning the same vars, etc., we can do that in one place. Lets create a new directory /
php/includes/guestbook/ and make a new file called setup.php. In our example environment, /php/includes is in
our include_path. Be sure you set this up too, or use absolute file paths.

**Example 2.10. Editing /php/includes/guestbook/setup.php
**

// load Smarty library

require(‘Smarty.class.php’);

// The setup.php file is a good place to load

// required application library files, and you

// can do that right here. An example:


// require(‘guestbook/guestbook.lib.php’);

class Smarty_GuestBook extends Smarty {

function Smarty_GuestBook()

{

// Class Constructor.

// These automatically get set with each new instance.

$this->Smarty();

$this->template_dir = ‘/web/www.example.com/smarty/guestbook/templates/’;

$this->compile_dir = ‘/web/www.example.com/smarty/guestbook/templates_c/’;

$this->config_dir = ‘/web/www.example.com/smarty/guestbook/configs/’;

$this->cache_dir = ‘/web/www.example.com/smarty/guestbook/cache/’;

$this->caching = true;

$this->assign(‘app_name’, ‘Guest Book’);

}

}

?>


Now lets alter the index.php file to use setup.php:
Example 2.11. Editing /web/www.example.com/docs/guestbook/index.php

require(‘guestbook/setup.php’);

$smarty = new Smarty_GuestBook();

$smarty->assign(‘name’,’Ned’);

$smarty->display(‘index.tpl’);

?>

Now you see it is quite simple to bring up an instance of Smarty, just use Smarty_GuestBook() which automatically ini-tializes everything for our application.
